# notetaker

This application is designed to allow a user to take notes, edit notes, and delete notes. 

Once the user launches the application, they should be able to make a new note. They can create a title for each note and add whatever content that they wish. Then the not can be saved in a seperate column so user can orgaize their thoughts.  

The notes can not be edited, but they can be deleted. I attempted to take the routes provided in what was given and connect everything so it worked properly.
